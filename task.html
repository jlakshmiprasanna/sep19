    <p><b>DATA TYPES </b>: The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects: Built-in-object they are:</p>
    <p>1.Primitive data type</p>
    <p>2.Non-primitive data type</p><br>
    <p>Primitive data type:---</p>
    <p>1.String: They are made up of a list of <b>CHARACTERS</b>, which is essentially just an characters.</p>
    <p>2.Numbers: Unlike other programming languages, you don’t need <b>INT,FLOAT</b> etc to declare different numeric values.</p>
    <p>3.Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: <b>TRUE OR FALSE</b></p>
    <p>4.Null: This type has only one value that is null.</p>
    <p>5.Undefined:  A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.</p><br>
    <p>Non-primitive data type:---</p>
    <p>1.Object: It is the most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.</p>
    <p>2.Array: </p><br>
    <p><b>VARIABLES</b> : variables are used to store and manage data. They are created using they are:</p>
    <p>1.var:The var was the sole keyword for variable declaration, without block scope, unlike let and const.</p>
    <p>2.let:The let keyword in JavaScript is used to make variables that are scoped to the block they’re declared in. Once you’ve used let to define a variable, you cannot declare it again within the same block.</p>
    <p>3.const:The const keyword in JavaScript is used to define variables that cannot be changed once they’re assigned a value. This prevents any modifications to the variable’s value.</p>
